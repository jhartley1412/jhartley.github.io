Week 1

So far the Iron Yard has been interesting. It’s defiantly been a refreshing change from working at a restaurant for the past 4 months, not doing anything design related and feeling stagnant. I’m hoping however, that this is the only week were I don’t feel challenged. So far everything has been review, most of which I’ve self-taught, and I’m ready to get further in depth about everything web/UI design. 
I’ve really like the structure of the program so far (again, a lot of the “you will have tough times here” attitude reminds me a lot of college) and I’m really enjoying the videos and talks that we’re being shown to. I guess I’m just used to a college/flexible setting though, I keep wanting to leave after the lecture and work on the homework assignments elsewhere. I don’t always work well in a giant room with a lot of people, I enjoy having some quiet private space every now and then. Hopefully I’ll find that little nook somewhere later on in the course. 
I'm really excited about the next couple of weeks!
